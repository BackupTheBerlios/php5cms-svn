# just like in PHP, a variable can pass from integer to string
# without casting that's why a string has no delimiters.
# a valid declaration is like:
# *name*=*value*
# where * are whitespaces. This enables you to tab declarations ;)

var {
  # int
  x = 1
  # array with 2 elements, an integer and another array with 2
  # strings just like in PHP, arrays are polymorphic
  y = [3;[+;a]]
}

# a section name can have spaces the name is trimed from the first
# character of the line to the character before the '{'
section name {
  # a simple string
  a = this is a string
}

# it can have all type of characters (this, for example, will not
# be evaluated
$a {
  valid = yes
}
