INSTALLATION
============

Just put the Abstractpage folder somewhere below your web root.
You have to include prepend.php (in the case of server side
scripting) or prepend.js (in the case of client side
scripting) to make the libraries work.

For your convenience you can also put prepend.php as auto 
prepend file in your php.ini

Some basic configuration data (e.g. path informations) can be found
at {abstractpage_root}/config/basic.php.

Please chmod the directories tmp and var to 0777 or use
the tiny shell script chmod.sh which resides in the root
directory of the Abstractpage Web Framework.

You need PHP 4.3.x to unleash the full power of Abstractpage.
